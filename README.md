# Complex Network Analysis on PDC World Darts Championships

The tournament years for the networks analyzed in the study are given below:
Nowadays, people's interaction is increasing with the development of technology, and a lot of data is obtained as a result of this interaction increase. As a result of modeling these data obtained from interactions, connections in daily life form parts of a complex network. The analysis of these links, which create complex networks, is important both in understanding the structure of the relationships and in predicting the future behavior of the network. In this context, the science of complex networks allows us to examine the relationships based on real life, combined with the nodes that represent the network actors and the graphs that enable us to determine logical relationships through the edge representations that represent the relationships between these nodes. Complex network science is used in the analysis of real world networks that are directly or indirectly related to each other. In this study, a network structure was created based on the world darts championships organized by the Professional Darts Organization (PDC) between 1994 and 2022. Dart players represent the node structures of the created network, while the tournaments between the players denote the edges. It has been investigated whether the created network carries the complex network principles and the structural relations that are visualized. In the structurals analysis of the network, principles such as small world theory, clustering and scale-free networks were also included in the analysis process. As a result of this study, it is seen that the real world network created from the relations between the players includes the features of complex network principles and the obtained data can be used in complex network analysis processes.
